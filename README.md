 ### ðŸ’» I mainly code with Python and HTML/CSS/JS with the awesome code editor Sublime Text âœ¨ (rest in peace notepad)
 ### ðŸ“ˆ I like breaking everything, finding bugs and just constantly tampering with programs
 
<details>
    <summary>Games broken so far</summary>
    
     * Genshin Impact - out of map, broke ability cool-down, made paimon transcend out of existence, made wishes on non existing banner
     * Minecraft - tampered with game code, save files, and much more
     * Overwatch - out of map and explored around
     * Overwatch 2 - also out of map a few days after the release
     * Warframe - transformed enemy in canon ball and transcended out of map
     * Slime Rancher - access zones of map before possible
     * Forza Horizon 2 - out of map
     * Forza Motosport 7 - transcended out of map in main menu
     * Tera - out of map
     * Undertale - tampered with game code
     * Goat Simulator - under map
     * Calico - pass though wall
     * Fortnite - out of map
     * Gmod - self explanatory, their physics engine sucks and therefore games like Half Life, Portal and Stanley Parable were also broken
     * Minecraft Dungeons - made illegal moves and crashed game way too many times
     * Yandere Simulator - out of map, made items and npc vanish out of existence

And a few others too that I may have forgot

 ### ðŸ—¿ breaking [Overwatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOvITjNzI28) and [Genshin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrFx7MTdbVA&t=66s)
 
 ### ðŸ¤” Currently learning how to reverse engineer stuff (mainly unity games [like Genshin](https://github.com/Escartem/GenshinTextures) but also other games like [Omori](https://github.com/Escartem/OmoriSource)), and extract stuff from them.
 
 ### :atom: Working on ${ \left({{\lim_{x \to 7} {{x^2 - 36} \over {x + 6}}} - {\lim_{x \to 0}{ {e^{9x} - 1} \over {x} }}}\right) \left({\left({{\lim_{x \to 0}{ {e^{2x} - 1} \over {x} }} - (\cos^2x + \sin^2x)}\right) + {\lim_{x \to 0}{ {-\ln(1 + 9(e^{-x} - 1))} \over {x} }}}\right) + {{\lim_{x \to \infty}{{ 45x^{2} + 10x  } \over {{ 5x^{2} + 9x  }}}}}{\left({{\lim_{x \to \infty}{x^{1/x}}} - {\lim_{x \to -7} {{x^2 - 64} \over {x - 8}}} + {\lim_{x \to 0}{ {e^{9x} - 1} \over {x} }}} \right)} }-1$ projects at the same time ðŸ˜Ž

     <summary>Some additional stuff I accomplished (outdated btw)</summary>
     
     * bypassed free trials and licenses of many websites and softwares with multiples methods such as tampering with network
     * accessed school server admin panel and leaked usernames and passwords of every users among with wifi password (but I'm fine they were more impressed than angry against me :D)
     * unlocked way too many pc without the passwords security kinda sucks
     * jailbroke school pc, removed spyware and bypassed bios passwords to reinstall os. And also leaked all components, drivers and included software for others students to mod it.
     * reversed engineered covid qr codes to prove you don't have covid to make custom legal ones (only for my own learning did not shared anything with anyone pls no jail :c )
     
     * learned english, programming, drawing and all the rest myself, I hate following tutorials and have people to teach me
     * made my own qrcodes that are not working anymore
     * created 3D engines with Scratch cuz i was bored and also recreated entire FNAF 1 within Scratch too
     * rickrolled my entire city with qrcodes sticked everywhere >:D
     * infinite money glitch with vending machines when your credits are stored on your card and not in the machine (not even encrypted in the card they really wanted to give you free hot chocolate)
     * please youtube stop updating your app I need your bugs to skip all ads :c (until i find a way to get free yt premium)
     * sometime I create games for me and my friends (rpg maker and godot if someone is interested)
     * why pay for software and games when you can get them for free on sketchy russians websites
