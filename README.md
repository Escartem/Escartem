 ### ðŸ’» I use `Python` and `HTML-CSS-JS`
 ### ðŸ“ˆ I like breaking everything, finding bugs and I'm constantly tampering with programs
 
<details>
    <summary>Games broken so far</summary>
    
     * Genshin Impact - out of map, broke ability cool-down, made paimon transcend out of existence, made wishes on non existing banner
     * Minecraft - tampered with game code, save files, and much more
     * Overwatch - out of map and explored around
     * Warframe - transformed enemy in canon ball and transcended out of map
     * Slime Rancher - access zones of map before possible
     * Forza Horizon 2 - out of map
     * Forza Motosport 7 - transcended out of map in main menu
     * Tera - out of map
     * Undertale - tampered with game code
     * Goat Simulator - under map
     * Calico - pass though wall
     * Fortnite - out of map
     * Gmod - self explanatory, their physics engine sucks and therefore games like Half Life, Portal and Stanley Parable were also broken
     * Minecraft Dungeons - made illegal moves and crashed game way too many times
     * Yandere Simulator - out of map, made items and npc vanish out of existence

And a few others too
