     <summary>Do you want some additional stuff I accomplished (still outdated btw (cringe bro))</summary>
     
     * bypassed free trials and licenses of many websites and softwares with multiples methods such as tampering with network
     * accessed school server admin panel and leaked usernames and passwords of every users among with wifi password (but I'm fine they were more impressed than angry against me :D)
     * unlocked way too many pc without the passwords security kinda sucks
     * jailbroke school pc, removed spyware and bypassed bios passwords to reinstall os. And also leaked all components, drivers and included software for others students to mod it.
     * reversed engineered covid qr codes to prove you don't have covid to make custom legal ones (only for my own learning did not shared anything with anyone pls no jail :c )
     
     * learned english, programming, drawing and all the rest myself, I hate following tutorials and have people to teach me
     * made my own qrcodes that are not working anymore
     * created 3D engines with Scratch cuz i was bored and also recreated entire FNAF 1 within Scratch too
     * rickrolled my entire city with qrcodes sticked everywhere >:D
     * infinite money glitch with vending machines when your credits are stored on your card and not in the machine (not even encrypted in the card they really wanted to give you free hot chocolate)
     * please youtube stop updating your app I need your bugs to skip all ads :c (until i find a way to get free yt premium)
     * sometime I create games for me and my friends (rpg maker and godot if someone is interested)
     * why pay for software and games when you can get them for free on sketchy russians websites

funny fact, this block of math breaks github markdown and every embed image beyond it won't load and return a violation in content security policy directive, i think this is bug, i'll report one day eventually, but that's why it's at the bottom
